Notes:
- The structure of all the config files loaded in the Windows Service is JSON format and all the config files are combined into a single JSON object in IConfiguration object.
- The names and id of the Workers in the worker config files must be unique.
- To register a Windows service manually, execute the following command on elevated command prompt -
	sc.exe create "My Sample Windows Service" binPath="<Path to MySampleWindowsService.exe> /JsonServiceConfig=""sample-win-service-config.development.json"" /AdditionalJsonConfigs:0="""Worker\additional-command-args-settings.json;Worker\additional-config-settings.json"""
